# Swarm: The simple Blog app

Swarm is created to really give a simple feeling to blogging. It works as expected, 
just add your content to the Content directory which is structured as:
- Company[]
   - Author[]
      - Blog[]


Get the latest version of the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Baudin999/swarm.git
cd swarm
yarn
```

If you want to start developing with a watch on the files, run:

```
npm run dev
```

A browser will automatically be openend at the right location http://localhost:3000. Look at the `package.json` to see the different scripts you can run.
