# Swarm: The simple Blog app

Swarm is created to really give a simple feeling to blogging. It works as expected, 
just add your content to the Content directory which is structured as:
- Company[]
   - Author[]
      - Blog[]


Get the latest version of the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Baudin999/swarm.git
cd swarm
yarn
```


run the command:

```
yarn build
```

and start the server:

```
yarn server
```

You can now open your browser at http://localhost:3000 and enjoy your content. Developing on top of swarm is 
as easy as creating a normal React application. The only thing you cannot do is modify the structure of the content.
